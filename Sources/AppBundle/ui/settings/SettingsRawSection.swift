/// `[key-mapping]` lives in a separate section of the form — so without this preamble,
/// two things could go wrong when parsing the pane's text alone:
///
/// - `notationOverrides` (`[key-mapping.key-notation-to-key-code]`) is where this
///   actually bites: it lets a user name a custom notation (e.g. `zz`) for a binding.
///   Without the override table present, that notation isn't in *any* preset's map, so
///   `alt-zz = '...'` — perfectly valid in the real file — reports a false "Can't parse
///   the key" error here.
/// - `preset` is included too, for defense in depth, even though today's three preset
///   tables (`keysMap.swift`) happen to share the exact same set of notation strings and
///   only differ in which physical key each one resolves to — so on its own, a plain
///   dvorak/colemak notation never actually fails to parse for lack of this. It costs
///   nothing to include and stays correct if that ever changes.
///
/// Window rules and callbacks don't need an equivalent: their `run` / callback values go
/// through `parseCommandOrCommands` → `parseCommand`, which parses each command as a
/// self-contained CLI-style argument list with no dependency on key mapping, modes, or
/// any other table (mode/workspace names referenced by a command, e.g. `mode main` or
/// `move-node-to-workspace foo`, are resolved at run time, not at parse time).
