# AeroSpace-edge

**AeroSpace, with upstream's fixes already in.** An i3-like tiling window manager for
macOS — no SIP disabling, no private APIs, no window animations to wait on.

## Why it exists

The fix you need is usually written before you hit the bug. It sits in a merged commit or an
open pull request while the release it belongs to takes months to land.

AeroSpace-edge closes that gap. Upstream's work gets picked up, adapted, tested and shipped in
weeks rather than release cycles. Same tree model, same config file, same commands — if you've
used AeroSpace you already know how to use this. What differs is the release cadence and what's
already fixed.

Versions are `1.MINOR[.PATCH]`, numbered independently of upstream — minor for new behavior,
patch for fixes and packaging. Every backport is traceable to its upstream PR in the
[fork changelog](https://github.com/vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).

## What you get

<div class="edge-features" markdown>

<div markdown>
### Tree-based tiling
Windows live in a tree of horizontal and vertical containers, plus accordion layouts for
narrow screens. Split, join, swap and resize any node — not just leaves.
[Read about the tree →](guide.md#tree)
</div>

<div markdown>
### Real keyboard control
Every action is bindable. Binding modes give you i3-style layers, so one chord opens a whole
sub-language of resize or move keys instead of eating a modifier.
[Binding modes →](guide.md#binding-modes)
</div>

<div markdown>
### Workspaces that aren't Spaces
AeroSpace emulates its own workspaces instead of driving macOS Spaces, so switching is instant
and scriptable — no animation, no Mission Control, no AppleScript hacks.
[Emulation of virtual workspaces →](guide.md#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces)
</div>

<div markdown>
### A CLI you can script
`aerospace-edge` talks to the running app over a UNIX socket. Query state as JSON, pipe
commands together, subscribe to events, and drive it all from your status bar.
[Command reference →](#commands)
</div>

<div markdown>
### Plain-text config
One TOML file, comments and all. No hidden state — diff it, version it, share it. The
Settings window edits that same file in place and keeps your comments.
[Settings →](settings/index.md) · [Default config →](guide.md#default-config)
</div>

<div markdown>
### Shortcuts, Spotlight and Focus
Commands are exposed as native App Intents. Drive workspaces from Shortcuts, run a command from
Spotlight, or attach a workspace to a macOS Focus mode.
[App Intents →](guide.md#shortcuts-spotlight-and-focus-filters)
</div>

<div markdown>
### Installs next to anything
Own bundle id, app name, socket, CLI and Accessibility grant. It never overwrites an existing
AeroSpace, and it reads your existing `~/.aerospace.toml` so a side-by-side comparison is fair.
</div>

</div>

## What's already fixed here

Grab a release if any of these have bitten you.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Crashes** | `is already unbound` when two `focus` commands race · `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` during display reconfiguration · `ThreadGuardedValue` crash · `die`/`dieT` deadlock |
| **Windows in the wrong place** | native tabs (Finder, Ghostty, Fork) leaving phantom tiles · windows flashing tiled before a floating rule applies · floating windows misplaced after screen wake · Emacs / Outlook / Codex / iTerm2 Settings popups mis-detected |
| **Layout math** | [`balance-sizes`](commands/balance-sizes.md) throwing away container weights, so a later [`resize`](commands/resize.md) made windows jump |
| **CLI** | [`layout sticky`](commands/layout.md) · [`list-windows --sort`](commands/list-windows.md) · [per-workspace `enable-normalization`](commands/enable-normalization.md) · [`summon-workspace --when-visible`](commands/summon-workspace.md) · [`debug-windows --app-bundle-id`](commands/debug-windows.md) · resizable floating windows |
| **Integrations** | the socket protocol handshake modern clients expect (AeroKit, aerospace-swipe, the upstream cask CLI) |

And one option with no upstream equivalent, written here:

`focus-follows-app-activation = 'always' | 'smart'`

:   `smart` stops apps that raise themselves from dragging you across workspaces, unless a
    click preceded the activation.

    !!! warning

        `smart` currently has a known regression — see the
        [fork changelog](https://github.com/vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).
        The default `'always'` is the upstream behavior and is safe.

## How it stays trustworthy while moving fast

- **Every change is its own reviewed pull request** — never a bulk merge.
- **Nothing lands untested.** `build-debug.sh -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors` and `swift-test.sh`
  both pass before a branch merges.
- **Refactors and breaking config changes stay out.** Moving fast on fixes and slow on churn is
  what keeps a fork from rotting.
- **Every backport is traceable** to the upstream PR it came from, where the credit belongs.

## Install

```shell
brew install --cask vitorebatista/tap/aerospace-edge
```

Or download the latest zip from
[**Releases**](https://github.com/vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge/releases/latest), then:

```shell
unzip AeroSpace-edge-v*.zip
mv AeroSpace-edge-v*/AeroSpace-edge.app /Applications/
cp  AeroSpace-edge-v*/bin/aerospace-edge /usr/local/bin/   # or anywhere on your PATH
open -a /Applications/AeroSpace-edge.app
```

Both binaries are universal (arm64 + x86_64). You only do this once — after that,
**Check for Updates…** in the menu bar finds, downloads and installs new releases in place.

!!! warning "The one thing that will surprise you"

    Builds are signed ad-hoc, so macOS revokes the Accessibility grant on every upgrade. The
    app notices its permission is gone, clears its TCC entry, and exits at launch. **It looks
    like a crash. It isn't.**

    After installing or upgrading: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**,
    switch AeroSpace-edge on (add `/Applications/AeroSpace-edge.app` with **+** if the row
    isn't there), then launch it again. This is a separate entry from any other window
    manager's — granting it affects nothing else.

Confirm you're talking to the right server:

```shell
aerospace-edge --version   # client and server should report the same 1.x version
```
