# aerospace-edge layout

Change layout of the focused window or workspace root to the given layout

## Synopsis

```synopsis
aerospace-edge layout [-h|--help] [--window-id <window-id>|--root]
                 (h_tiles|v_tiles|h_accordion|v_accordion|tiles|accordion|horizontal|vertical|tiling|floating|sticky)...
```

## Description

By default, the command acts on the focused window’s parent container. With `--root`, the command acts on the workspace’s root tiling container instead, which lets you toggle the workspace-level layout without flattening nested sub-containers.

If several arguments are supplied then finds the first argument that doesn’t describe the currently active layout, and applies the layout.

- Change both tiling layout and orientation in one go: `h_tiles|v_tiles|h_accordion|v_accordion`

- Change tiling layout but preserve orientation: `tiles|accordion`

- Change orientation but preserve layout: `horizontal|vertical`

- Toggle floating/tiling mode: `tiling|floating` (not valid with `--root`)

- Toggle "sticky" mode of a floating window: `sticky` (a sticky floating window is shown on all workspaces of its monitor)

## Options

`-h`, `--help`

: Print help

`--window-id <window-id>`

: Act on the specified window instead of the focused window. The flag takes precedence over `AEROSPACE_WINDOW_ID` and `AEROSPACE_WORKSPACE` [environment variables](../guide.md#environment-variables).

`--root`

: Act on the focused workspace’s root tiling container instead of the focused window’s parent container. Succeeds even when no window is focused (the command operates on the root container directly), so it works on empty or floating-only workspaces. The `tiling` and `floating` descriptors are not valid with `--root` because they describe window placement modes, not container layouts. `--root` is mutually exclusive with `--window-id`.

  !!! note

      When `enable-normalization-flatten-containers` is enabled and the root has a single nested tiling container as its only child, the next normalization pass will replace the root with the nested container. In that specific tree shape, a `--root` toggle is effectively discarded by the next normalize.

## Examples

- Toggle between `floating` and `tiling` layouts (order of args doesn’t matter):  
  `aerospace-edge layout floating tiling`

- Toggle orientation (order of args doesn’t matter):  
  `aerospace-edge layout horizontal vertical`

- Toggle between `tiles` and `accordion` layouts (order of args doesn’t matter):  
  `aerospace-edge layout tiles accordion`

- Switch to `tiles` layout. Toggle the layout orientation if already in `tiles` layout:  
  `aerospace-edge layout tiles horizontal vertical`

- Toggle the workspace’s root layout between `tiles` and `accordion` without disturbing nested sub-containers:  
  `aerospace-edge layout --root tiles accordion`

- Toggle "sticky" mode of the focused floating window (show it on all workspaces of its monitor):  
  `aerospace-edge layout sticky`
