How the key names written in your bindings are resolved to physical keys. This changes
*interpretation*, never the text of your bindings.

## Preset

The keyboard layout your key notations are written for. `alt-h` means "the key labelled *h*
on this layout", so choosing the wrong preset moves every binding to a different physical
key without changing a single character of config.

**TOML** `key-mapping.preset` · **values** `qwerty` / `dvorak` / `colemak` ·
**default** `qwerty` · **applies** on reload, when hotkeys are rebuilt ·
see [Keyboard layouts](../guide.md#keyboard-layouts-and-key-mapping)

## Custom notation mapping

Overrides individual names, or invents new ones. Each row is the notation you use in
bindings on the left and an AeroSpace key-code name on the right. Overrides win over the
preset — useful for a different alphabet, or just a fancy alias; see
[Keyboard layouts and key mapping](../guide.md#keyboard-layouts-and-key-mapping) for
worked examples.

Notation names may not contain whitespace or `-`, and the value must be a key-code name
AeroSpace-edge knows. Both are checked when Save validates the file.

**TOML** `[key-mapping.key-notation-to-key-code]` · **default** empty table ·
**applies** on reload

!!! warning "Whole-family rewrite"

    Changing either control on this page regenerates the complete `key-mapping` family,
    including `[key-mapping.key-notation-to-key-code]`. Comments inside it do not survive
    the Save.
