> **For AI agents / future sessions:** this file is the single source of truth for "update my fork

> exact commands that work **in this environment**, and the env-specific gotchas. Follow it instead
> of re-discovering everything.

## The fork model

- The fork does **not** blindly track upstream `main`. It sits on a fixed **upstream base commit**
  plus a curated set of **backported bug fixes / small features**, each merged as its own PR.
- We intentionally **skip** large refactors and features that would conflict with the curated
  backports (see "Deliberately not ported" below).
- `origin` = `vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge` (the fork). `upstream` = `nikitabobko/AeroSpace`.
  **Renamed 2026-08-27** from `vitorebatista/AeroSpace`; GitHub redirects the old URL, but use the new
  name in commands. The app bundle id (`bobko.aerospace`) and the `aerospace` CLI name are deliberately
  unchanged — renaming those would break the socket path, third-party clients and users' configs.
  If `upstream` is missing: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace.git`

## Sync state (update this section every sync)

- **Upstream base commit:** `63e0976b` (the fork branched from upstream `main` here).
- **Last upstream review point:** upstream `main` @ `c548c7f8`, 59 open upstream PRs, reviewed
  2026-08-27. New work after this point is what a future sync should look at. (Previous point:
  `d56e1637`, reviewed 2026-07-18/07-23.) The 2026-08-27 sync found 2 new `main` commits — both
  skipped: `c548c7f8` (`Monitor` → `MonitorInfo` rename, part of the "track upstream main" milestone)
  and `ae2aa7aa` (upstream-only PR-labelling CI) — and 17 new open PRs, of which it ported #2244,
  #2232, #2211, #2228 and #2225 as fork PRs #55–#59.
- **Released:** `v0.20.3-Beta-fork.9` (fork PRs #55–#59, cut 2026-08-27) — bug-fix-only cycle:
  iTerm2 Settings window detection (#55), `isUnitTest` hot-path crash (#56), `balance-sizes` total
  weight (#57), `FocusCommand` "is already unbound" race crash (#58), native-tab window replacement
  into the old tree slot (#59). See [`CHANGELOG-FORK.md`](../CHANGELOG-FORK.md) for the per-PR fork
  adaptations.
  Previous: `v0.20.3-Beta-fork.8` (fork PR #54, cut 2026-07-24) — backports the upstream
  **socket protocol versions handshake** (`8413641c`, previously on the deferred list; explicitly
  requested to fix third-party socket clients — AeroKit, aerospace-swipe, upstream-cask CLI —
  hanging against the fork server). Adaptations: `getIgnoringErrorsOrNil()` → `getOrNil()`,
  EvalCommandTest tweak dropped, guide's Socket-protocol section appended at the end (fork guide
  has no Deprecations section).
  Previous: `v0.20.3-Beta-fork.7` (fork PR #53, cut 2026-07-24) — first release with a
  fork-original feature: `focus-follows-app-activation = 'always'|'smart'` (suppresses
  cross-workspace focus stealing by self-activating apps; no upstream equivalent).
  **`smart` has a known regression** (moved windows reappear on the current workspace) —
  see CHANGELOG-FORK.md fork.7 "KNOWN ISSUE" for details/fix direction before touching it.
- **Ad-hoc signing gotcha (hit on fork.7 install):** every fork release re-signs ad-hoc, so
  macOS invalidates the Accessibility grant on upgrade; the app then resets its own TCC entry
  and exits at startup (`checkAccessibilityPermissions`). After replacing the app the user must
  re-grant: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility (add via + if missing), then
  relaunch. Expect this on every `-fork.N` upgrade.
  Previous: `v0.20.3-Beta-fork.6` (46 backports total; fork PRs #50–#52, 2026-07-18).
  See [`CHANGELOG-FORK.md`](../CHANGELOG-FORK.md).
- **2026-07-23 sync check:** no new upstream-`main` commits (still `d56e1637`); 48 open PRs.
  Only new PR since 2026-07-18: **#2192** "Goodies: add Cyclist" (draft, docs-only one-liner) —
  deferred until it leaves draft.

### Deliberately NOT ported (skip unless explicitly requested)
- Upstream PR **#2114** "Add sticky window support" — duplicate of our `layout sticky` (PR #2083/#21).
- Upstream PR **#2108** "cycle window size at edge" — conflicts; not requested.
- Large upstream-`main` refactors after our base: the `on-window-detected[*].if` type change
  (TOML table → arbitrary command), the `InterVar` → typed-enum refactor, the
  `ConfigParseError` → `ConfigParseDiagnostic` rework, the Swift bump. These conflict with several
  curated backports. Pulling them in = a **full resync milestone**, not a quick PR — only do it if
  the user explicitly asks to "track upstream main."
- Upstream-`main` refactor chain merged 2026-06-10..06-14 (reviewed 2026-06-15, all part of the
  "track upstream main" milestone, not quick PRs):
  - `4242863b`/`cf6244e7`/`61f0eac9`/`cd64d085` — `ParseConfigResult.errors` → `ConfigParseDiagnostic`
    + readConfig return-type rework (the same family as the `ConfigParseDiagnostic` item above).
  - `317b8d38`/`175b88f6` — ReloadConfigCommand drops `Task.startUnstructured` (absent in fork).
  - `890ec336` — config "warnings mechanism".
  - `a0e43e55`/`6a118fe3` — `test` operator-syntax change + new `test-not` subcommand (breaking
    config-syntax change).
  - `5e37ec0a`/`90347dbb`/`f1f50259` — tree-structure refactor (FloatingWindowsContainer,
    TilingContainerParentCases) — 21-file refactor.
- Upstream **`layout --root` / `--workspace` / empty-workspace** feature set (`11ba9150`, `91064acc`,
  `bb1e5429`, completion fix `4ad2a573`) — features whose semantics sit on top of the `5e37ec0a` tree
  refactor above; can't be cleanly backported without dragging in the refactor. Skipped 2026-06-15
  (not requested). Revisit if/when a full resync happens.
- Upstream-`main` refactor/feature chain merged 2026-06-15..06-26 (reviewed 2026-06-29, all part of
  the "track upstream main" milestone, not quick PRs):
  - **eval/echo command family** (`82ee061c`, `f0c5ab43`, `5c9fc889`, `dac4671a`, `93b65b2d`,
    `0f0a1c80`, `588b1df1`, `6aad5704`, `c69087ec`, `b8e8dbba`, `63df9215`, `88e13b37`, `4b1c4c4c`)
    and `RunCallbackCommand` (`59b181c9`) + its prefactors (`fdb27c59`, `aa1f7ced`, `30566206`).
  - **focusFollowsMouse** (`b95537f2`, `987d1bd5`) and the non-cancellable-session rework
    (`ecfc745c`, `5742362b`, `0ff53e56`).
  - **`ConfigVersion`** strong typing (`5bb3701a`, `5c655bcf`), **`ConvenienceCopyable`** rename
    (`45939229`), **`Parsed`→`ResOrStr`/`ConfigParseDiagnostic`** rename (`c233adb0`), warnings array
    → `ConfigParserContext` (`5e9fdc92`), "Avoid TOML table syntax" (`30e461d7`), and the BREAKING
    "forbid empty `if` in on-window-detected" (`8ceabe9b`) — config-syntax changes that conflict.
  - ~~Socket-protocol versions handshake (`8413641c`)~~ — **ported 2026-07-24 as fork PR #54**
    (explicitly requested), `getNextPrevWorkspace` error-message chain
    (`1aeb8090`/`73a9137c`/`6e472aa3`/`310bd8e1`), accessibility-permission flow (`fb8b1df6`),
    `onWorkspaceChanged` self-conflicting-focus guard (`dd61a340` — already ported as #35).
  - Website/docs-only (`d14b4314`, `3d7fee52`, `61c874bc`, `6e4a2d2c`) and CI (`7d2654d5`).
- Upstream-`main` chain reviewed 2026-07-10 (`fb8b1df6..649301b2`), deferred to a full resync:
  - **focus-follows-mouse** feature (`747e1a97`, `f486beb2`, `9727340a`, `2dc0c786`) — deferred feature.
  - **`ef54f6c5`** (shell: allow comments after backslash) and **`f1cef2eb`** (drop stale
    `ShellParserGenerated`) — both target upstream's hand-written `shellLexer.swift`; the fork still
    uses the ANTLR-generated `ShellLexer`, so these are upstream's move *off* ANTLR, not portable.
  - **`4e240fed`** (isStartup: fix crash) — rewrites `isStartup` against the deleted `_isStartup`
    TaskLocal (`0ff53e56`); the fork's `isStartup` uses `_isStartup ?? dieT(...)`, so the upstream
    fix doesn't map. Revisit during a full resync.
  - **`269dc71b`** (MacApp getOrRegister: loop → single attempt) — targets the same infinite
    re-subscribe loop the fork already bounds via `shouldThrottleFailedRegistration` (fork PR #19);
    adopting it would mean removing the throttle. Its companions `dd6b927a`/`1e6ce27e` WERE ported (#43).
  - **`aa656637`** (make xcode project `git worktree`-friendly + move it) — project-layout
    restructure, not a fix. **`9c922252`** (socket Python example docs) — the fork has no
    socket-protocol guide section. **`e1310b5d`** (bugPrompt graceful/deadly logging), **`5be63812`**
    (update axDumps) — minor upstream-only tooling/data.
- Reviewed 2026-07-14 (`649301b2..d56e1637` + open PRs), deferred (not requested / risky):
  - `a52896b3` (default-config: shorten terminal-launch script) — cosmetic default-config change.
  - Upstream PR **#2174** "Restore windows after native fullscreen" (422 lines) — large feature.
  - Upstream PR **#2176** "add get_tree command" — new command/feature.
  - Upstream PR **#2179** "focus cross-monitor window via private SkyLight API" — risky (private API,
    touches `Package.swift`/`PrivateApi`).
  - Upstream PR **#2180** "Isolate window management from unresponsive apps" — reworks MacApp/
    AxSubscription; conflicts with the fork's AX re-subscribe throttle (`shouldThrottleFailedRegistration`,
    fork PR #19 / #43).
- Reviewed 2026-07-18 (no new `main` commits; new open PRs since 2026-07-14), still deferred:
  - Upstream PR **#2174** "Restore windows after native fullscreen", **#2176**/#2158 "get_tree/get-tree"
    (still open, still large features), **#2179** (private SkyLight API), **#2180** (unresponsive-app
    isolation) — all as noted above.
  - Upstream PR **#2190**'s follow-up `bsp-shape` normalizer (mentioned in the PR, not yet posted) —
    revisit when/if upstream opens it.
- Reviewed 2026-08-27 (`d56e1637..c548c7f8` + 17 new open PRs), deferred:
  - Upstream `main` `c548c7f8` (`Monitor` → `MonitorInfo` rename) — refactor, belongs to the "track
    upstream main" milestone. `ae2aa7aa` (auto-label incoming PRs) — upstream-only CI.
  - Upstream PRs **#2238** and **#2245** (focus-follows-mouse over Control Center / transient
    overlays) — **not portable**: both patch `Sources/AppBundle/mouse/focusFollowsMouse.swift`, and
    the fork never ported the focus-follows-mouse feature (deferred 2026-07-10). Revisit only if
    that feature is ever backported.
  - Upstream PR **#2220** ("on-window-detected 'layout floating' leaves the window at its tile
    origin") — **duplicate**: the fork already fixed this via upstream #2024 (fork commit
    `bad62837`, `isAwaitingOnWindowDetected`). The only delta #2220 adds on top is excluding
    awaiting windows from `layoutAccordion`'s index/padding math; marginal, and #2220 is unmerged.
  - Upstream PR **#2213** ("focus can land on a different window of the same app") — **conflicts
    with fork PR #59**: it deletes `MacApp.lastNativeFocusedWindowId`, which the #2225 native-tab
    backport depends on. Also `mergeable=dirty` upstream, needs `Task.startUnstructured` (absent in
    the fork), and overlaps the fork's own `focus-follows-app-activation` feature. Revisit if
    upstream merges it.
  - Upstream PR **#2206** ("Fix native tab window replacement") — competing implementation of the
    same bug as #2225; **#2225 was chosen** (fork PR #59). Don't port #2206 on top.
  - Feature PRs, deferred as not requested (fork bar is bug fixes + small safe features):
    **#2207** (`list-windows --sort-by`), **#2217** (`list-windows --layout` filter), **#2229**
    (`list-tree` command — same family as the already-deferred #2176/#2158 `get_tree`), **#2240**
    (`default-workspace-monitor` config), **#2241** (`menu-bar-item` config), **#2242**
    (`non-empty-workspaces-root-containers-layout-on-startup` → `tiles|accordion|smart` selector).
  - Still-draft: **#2192** (Goodies: add Cyclist), **#2201** (Restore focus after transient dialogs
    close) — revisit when they leave draft.
- Upstream CI / build-docs / test-infra commits (`e82b4644`/`78e6dd80`/`ebef281e` GH Actions,
  `2f4d5039`, `c28d3469`, `d07cfee4`, `6ec50638`, `e47d5989`, `abd944d7`, `e063e2fe`) — upstream-only
  tooling or docs for skipped features; nothing to port.

## Updating the fork from upstream — step by step

### 1. Find what's new (cheap; no code changes)
```bash
git fetch upstream --quiet
# New commits on upstream main since our base (already-ported shas are listed above — ignore them):
git log --oneline 63e0976b..upstream/main
# New OPEN upstream PRs (compare numbers against "Already backported" + "Not ported" lists above):
gh pr list --repo nikitabobko/AeroSpace --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,createdAt,isDraft --jq 'sort_by(.createdAt)[] | "\(.number)\t\(.createdAt[0:10])\t\(.title)"'
```
Classify the delta as bug-fix / safe-small-feature / large-feature / docs / obsolete. Default scope
is **bug fixes + safe small features**; confirm scope with the user before porting features.

### 2. Port each item on its own branch off `origin/main`
```bash
git checkout -B port/<slug> origin/main
```
- **From an upstream PR:** get the diff via the GitHub API (NOT `gh pr diff` — it is reformatted in
  this environment and won't `git apply`):
  ```bash
  gh api repos/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/pulls/<N> -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.diff" > /tmp/<N>.diff
  git apply --3way /tmp/<N>.diff      # on conflict: git apply --reject, then re-implement by hand
  ```
- **From an upstream `main` commit:** `git cherry-pick <sha>` (works because `upstream` is fetched).

### 3. Adapt to fork conventions (these differ from upstream)
- **`-strict-memory-safety` is on** → some reads need an explicit `unsafe` marker (e.g.
  `return unsafe _value`) that upstream omits. Add it when the compiler demands.
- **Command results** use `.succ` / `.fail(io.err("..."))` / `BinaryExitCode`, not bare `Bool`.
- **`terminationHandler`** is non-optional in the fork; there is no `Task.startUnstructured`.
- **Window-classification tests are data-driven**: add an `axDumps/*.json5` fixture with the
  expected result inline (e.g. `"Aero.AxUiElementWindowType": "popup"`) rather than a synthetic mock.
- **Generated files** (`cmdHelpGenerated.swift`, `subcommandDescriptionsGenerated.swift`) come from
  `docs/aerospace-*.adoc`. Edit the `.adoc`, then `./script/generate-cmd-help.sh` (build-debug
  regenerates `subcommandDescriptions`). Never hand-edit the generated `.swift`.
- **Docs are part of the change** (see CLAUDE.md command checklist): new flag/command/config/format
  var → update the relevant `.adoc` + `docs/guide.adoc`/`default-config.toml` + the `<event>`/rule in
  `grammar/commands-bnf-grammar.txt`.

### 4. Verify every branch (the bar)
```bash
./build-debug.sh -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors    # must exit 0 (warnings are errors)
./swift-test.sh                                   # rely on exit 0 + "✅ Swift tests have passed"
```
The "Test run with 0 tests in 0 suites passed" line is normal (Swift Testing framework); XCTest pass
lines are filtered by the script. IDE/SourceKit diagnostics often lag and show false errors after a
merge — trust the `-warnings-as-errors` build, not the diagnostics.

### 5. Open one PR per fix
```bash
git push -u origin port/<slug>
gh pr create --repo vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge --base main --head port/<slug> --title "..." --body "..."
```
gh's default repo is the fork (`gh repo set-default vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge` if ever needed) — always
pass `--repo vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge` to be safe. PR body: summary + `Ports nikitabobko/AeroSpace#<N>`
(or `Backports upstream commit <sha>`) + test/doc coverage + caveats.

### 6. Merge (local merge train — handles the many shared-file conflicts efficiently)
Merging one-by-one on GitHub triggers cascading rebases. Instead, integrate locally in dependency
order, then push (GitHub auto-marks each PR "Merged" once its branch tip is in `main`):
```bash
git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main
git merge --no-ff --no-edit origin/port/<slug> -m "Merge pull request #<forkN> from vitorebatista/port/<slug>" -m "<title>"
# ... repeat per branch; merge independent ones first, file-sharing ones adjacently.
```
- **Additive config conflicts** (two PRs both add fields to `Config.swift`/`parseConfig.swift`/
  `ConfigTest.swift`/`default-config.toml`, empty diff3 base) → resolve by **union** (keep both
  sides). Watch for a function whose closing `}` lived in the shared post-conflict region (union can
  drop one brace — add it back; the build will flag it).
- After all merges: one final `./build-debug.sh -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors` + `./swift-test.sh`,
  confirm no conflict markers (`git grep -nE '^(<<<<<<<|>>>>>>>)' -- . ':!docs/superpowers'`), then
  `git push origin main`.

## Building a release binary (what actually works in this environment)

`./build-release.sh` **fails here** on optional packaging extras (not the app): `build-docs.sh`
needs Ruby-under-`mise` on PATH, `build-shell-completion.sh` needs `fish` + `bash >= 5` — none are
installed. Two workarounds:

**A. Make the official script work** (if you want man pages + completions): `brew install fish bash`,
and add a `mise` shim so the docs step's rubygems plugin finds it:
```bash
printf "exec '/opt/homebrew/bin/mise' \"\$@\"\n" > .deps/bin/mise && chmod +x .deps/bin/mise
NUKE_PATH=1 PATH="$PWD/.deps/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/bin:/usr/bin" \
  ./build-release.sh --build-version "0.20.3-Beta-fork.N" --codesign-identity -
```

**B. Lean build (recommended — app + CLI, no man pages/completions).** Put the steps in a script and
run it with `zsh script.sh`, because the interactive shell hook rewrites `rm`/`ls`/etc. (e.g. it turns
`rm -rf` into GNU-flagged `rm` that fails on macOS); running inside a script file bypasses the rewrite.
The script (see git history of `/tmp/lean-release2.sh` pattern) does, with
`NUKE_PATH=1 PATH="$PWD/.deps/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/bin:/usr/bin"`:
1. `./generate.sh --ignore-shell-parser --ignore-cmd-help --build-version "0.20.3-Beta-fork.N" --codesign-identity - --generate-git-hash`
2. `swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64 --product aerospace -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`
3. `xcrun xcodebuild clean build -scheme AeroSpace -destination "generic/platform=macOS" -configuration Release -derivedDataPath .xcode-build`
4. `git checkout .` (restores generated files + `project.pbxproj` that xcodegen/version-stamping dirtied)
5. assemble `.release/AeroSpace-v<ver>/` = `AeroSpace.app` (from `.xcode-build/Build/Products/Release/`)
   + `bin/aerospace` (`codesign -s - --force`) + `legal/`, then `zip -qr`.
- The app is codesigned ad-hoc by xcodebuild (`--codesign-identity -`); both binaries come out universal.
- **Verify** baked-in version WITHOUT running the CLI (it can hang in non-interactive shells):
  `plutil -extract CFBundleShortVersionString raw .release/AeroSpace.app/Contents/Info.plist` and
  `strings .release/aerospace | grep <ver>`.

## Creating the GitHub release
```bash
gh release create "v0.20.3-Beta-fork.N" ".release/AeroSpace-v0.20.3-Beta-fork.N.zip" \
  --repo vitorebatista/AeroSpace-edge --target main --prerelease \
  --title "AeroSpace v0.20.3-Beta-fork.N" --notes-file <notes.md>
```
- Version scheme: upstream beta base + `-fork.N`; bump `N` each release. The version shows in the
  menu bar and `aerospace --version`.
- Do **not** use `script/publish-release.sh` (it pushes tags to the upstream repo).
- After releasing, **update the "Sync state" section above** and append to `CHANGELOG-FORK.md`.

## CI
`.github/workflows/build.yml` verifies builds across macOS versions once GitHub Actions is enabled on
the fork. `close-third-party-issues.yml` is upstream-only tooling — safe to disable on the fork.
